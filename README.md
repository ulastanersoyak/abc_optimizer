# artificial bee colony (abc) algorithm 

## what is abc?
the artificial bee colony algorithm is inspired by how honey bees find and share information about food sources. it's used to solve optimization problems by mimicking how bee colonies work together to find the best food sources.

## how it works

### the core idea
imagine food sources as possible solutions to a problem. better food sources (more nectar) represent better solutions. the bees work together to find and remember the best food sources, just like we want to find the best solution to our problem.

### types of bees
the algorithm uses three types of bees, each with a specific job:

1. **employed bees**
   - each is assigned to one food source
   - explores around their assigned area
   - memorizes better spots they find
   - shares information with other bees

2. **onlooker bees**
   - wait in the hive
   - listen to employed bees' information
   - choose which food sources to visit based on how good they are
   - more likely to visit better food sources

3. **scout bees**
   - look for new food sources randomly
   - replace employed bees who've spent too long at an unproductive source
   - help avoid getting stuck in poor areas

## the process step by step

1. **starting out**
   - randomly place employed bees at different food sources
   - each food source is a possible solution

2. **main loop**
   - employed bees check around their food source for better spots
   - they return and share information
   - onlooker bees choose which sources to visit
   - if a source isn't improving, send a scout bee to find a new one
   - remember the best source found so far

3. **finishing up**
   - after enough iterations, return the best solution found

## test functions in the code

1. **rastrigin**
   - lots of local best points
   - hard to find the true best point
   - good for testing if the algorithm can avoid getting stuck

2. **rosenbrock**
   - like a curved valley
   - easy to find the valley
   - hard to find the exact best point

3. **sphere**
   - simple test function
   - like a bowl shape
   - easy to solve, good for testing

## visualization
the code shows two main things:

1. **landscape view**
   - shows where all the bees are
   - helps us see how they move around
   - darker areas are better solutions

2. **progress tracker**
   - shows how well we're doing over time
   - tracks the best and average solutions

## why use abc?
abc is good because:
- doesn't need much setup
- can handle complex problems
- works well when you have many local best points
- easy to understand and implement
- can be used for many different types of problems

## common uses
- finding best parameters for systems
- training neural networks
- designing engineering systems
- optimizing real-world problems

## limitations
- can be slower than some other methods
- might need tuning for specific problems
- works best with continuous problems (things with smooth changes)

## project structure

### 1. main.py (entry point)
this file starts everything up and contains:
```python
test_functions = {
    'rastrigin': {
        'function': rastrigin_function,
        'bounds': [(-5.12, 5.12), (-5.12, 5.12)],
        'global_minimum': 0.0
    }
    # more test functions...
}
```
- defines test problems
- sets up optimization parameters
- runs the main optimization loop

### 2. optimizer.py (core logic)
this handles the main bee colony behavior:
```python
class abc_optimizer:
    def __init__(self, objective_func, bounds, colony_size=100):
        # setup colony parameters
        
    def optimize(self):
        # run optimization phases
```
- manages bee populations
- controls search process
- tracks best solutions

### 3. objectives.py (test functions)
contains different problems to solve:
```python
def rastrigin_function(x):
    # challenging multimodal function
    
def sphere_function(x):
    # simple test function
```
- provides test problems
- defines solution spaces
- sets optimization goals

### 4. visualization.py (display)
shows how the optimization is going:
```python
class optimization_visualizer:
    def __init__(self, bounds, objective_func):
        # setup plots
        
    def update(self, iteration, food_sources):
        # update display
```
- draws current bee positions
- shows progress over time
- helps understand the search process
